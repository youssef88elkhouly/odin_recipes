# odin_recipes

In this simple project I will test the HTML skills I learned in the Odin Project

Which are the basics of HTML

This project will contain a list of recipes. 

I used h1 as the main header for all pages
h3 for the ingredients and steps titles

For the ingredients I used an unordered list and for the steps I used an ordered list

I also made numbers in bold using strong tag

I made the dimensions for the images 310x310

I added css I used borders, margins, padding, color, background color, and I also added a background for the whole page

I used classes and id's in the css
