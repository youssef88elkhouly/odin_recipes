    <p>You'll love this Rib Eye Roastâ€”succulent, buttery beef with a rich, caramelized crust. Slow-roasted to juicy perfection,
         it's an impressive yet simple centerpiece for any feast.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1</strong> cup softened butter</li>
        <li><strong>6</strong> cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li><strong>1 (4 pound)</strong> bone-in rib-eye roast</li>
        <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to <strong>500 degrees F (260 degrees C)</strong>.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and garlic together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Poke several holes in rib eye with a sharp knife. Rub butter mixture all over meat and season with salt and pepper. Place rib eye fat-side up in a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for <strong>20 minutes.</strong></li>
        <li>Reduce heat to <strong>325 degrees F (165 degrees C)</strong> and continue cooking until rib eye is reddish-pink and juicy in the center,
             <strong>1 1/2 to 2 hours.</strong> An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read <strong>145 degrees F (63 degrees C)</strong> for medium.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
